## 풀린 문제 (Solved Tasks)

### Task ccd554ac ✅

**1. Pattern Recognition – The Transformation Rule**

All six training examples share a single, very simple geometric rule:

*Given an *n × n* input grid, produce an *n² × n²* output grid that is a **tiled repetition** of the input pattern.*

Formally, if the input grid is `I` with indices `I[a][b]` for `0 ≤ a,b < n`, then the output `O` of size `n²` is defined by  

```
O[i][j] = I[ i mod n ][ j mod n ]          (0 ≤ i,j < n²)
```

In other words, the input block is copied `n` times side‑by‑side and `n` times stacked on top of each other, so that every `n × n` sub‑block of the output is **identical to the original input**.

Evidence from the examples:

| Example | n | Output dimension | Observation |
|---------|---|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 3 | 9 × 9 | Every 3 × 3 block = original 3 × 3 input |
| 2 | 2 | 4 × 4 | Every 2 × 2 block = original 2 × 2 input |
| 3 | 2 | 4 × 4 | Same as above |
| 4 | 3 | 9 × 9 | Same as above |
| 5 | 4 | 16 × 16 | Same as above |
| 6 | 4 | 16 × 16 | Same as above |

The rule is independent of the particular colors or values used; it only depends on the size `n` of the input.

**2. My Approach to the Test Input**

The test input is a 5 × 5 grid:

```
0 8 8 0 0
8 8 8 8 8
0 8 8 0 0
8 8 8 8 8
0 8 8 0 8
```

Applying the rule:

1. Compute `n = 5`.  
2. Construct an output grid `O` of size `25 × 25`.  
3. For every coordinate `(i, j)` in `O`, set  
   `O[i][j] = I[ i mod 5 ][ j mod 5 ]`.

The result is a 25 × 25 grid that consists of the original 5 × 5 pattern repeated 5 times horizontally and 5 times vertically. The first row of the output is simply the input first row repeated 5 times, the second row is the input second row repeated 5 times, and so on for all 25 rows.

The produced output matches the provided ground‑truth exactly.

**3. Success Factors – Why This Task is Solvable**

- **Deterministic, Size‑Dependent Mapping**: The transformation depends only on the dimension `n` of the input
