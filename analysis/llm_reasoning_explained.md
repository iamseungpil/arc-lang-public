## ✅ Task 833dafe3 (SOLVED)

### Pattern Recognition

The input is an \(N \times N\) grid.
The output is a \(2N \times 2N\) grid composed of four \(N \times N\) quadrants:

| Quadrant | Transformation of the input |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Top‑Left | Flip both horizontally and vertically (rotate 180°) |
| Top‑Right| Flip vertically only |
| Bottom‑Left | Flip horizontally only |
| Bottom‑Right | No change (original) |

Thus each quadrant is a specific mirror/rotation of the original grid.

### Analysis

The transformation is systematic and deterministic:
1. **Identify the input grid size**: N×N
2. **Create 2N×2N output grid**
3. **Apply transformations**:
   - Top-left quadrant: Rotate 180° (equivalent to flipping both axes)
   - Top-right quadrant: Flip vertically (mirror across horizontal axis)
   - Bottom-left quadrant: Flip horizontally (mirror across vertical axis)
   - Bottom-right quadrant: Keep original

### Application to Test Input

For the test input (a 4×4 grid with colors), the model successfully:
- Expanded to 8×8 output
- Applied all four transformations correctly to create the quadrants
- Maintained color consistency across all transformations

### Model Success Factors

1. **Clear compositional structure**: Pattern can be decomposed into 4 independent transformations
2. **Systematic rules**: No ambiguity in how each quadrant is generated
3. **Multiple training examples**: 6 examples provided consistent demonstration
4. **No semantic interpretation needed**: Pure geometric transformations

**Result**: Model solved correctly ✓

## ❌ Task ad7e01d0 (UNSOLVED)

### Pattern Recognition

The rule is:

1. Find the most frequent non‑zero color in the input grid.
2. Create an output grid whose size is the input size squared (i.e., if the input is \(n \times n\), the output is \((n^2) \times (n^2)\)).
3. Divide the output into \(n \times n\) blocks, each block being \(n \times n\).
4. For each block at position \((i,j)\):
   * If the cell \((i,j)\) in the input grid is the most frequent non‑zero color, fill that block with the entire input grid.
   * Otherwise, fill the block with zeros.

### Analysis

The model attempted to understand the pattern as:
- **Input analysis**: Identify dominant color from 3×3 input
- **Scale expansion**: 3×3 → 9×9 (size squared)
- **Block-based transformation**: Each 3×3 block corresponds to one input cell
- **Conditional filling**: Blocks filled based on input cell color

### Application to Test Input

The model's approach:
1. Identified the input as a 3×3 grid with colored squares
2. Attempted to expand to 9×9 output
3. Tried to apply block-level transformations based on color matching

### Model Failure Analysis

**Why this approach failed**:

1. **Abstract semantic interpretation**: The model misunderstood the actual transformation rule
2. **Template complexity**: The real pattern involves decorative cross motifs, not simple grid replication
3. **Near-miss**: The model understood high-level concepts (expansion, block-based transformation) but missed precise details
4. **Insufficient examples**: Only 4 training examples may not have been enough to capture the decorative motif structure

**Key insight**: The model understood the general structure (small input → large output with pattern repetition) but failed to recognize that individual colored cells map to specific decorative templates (cross patterns with internal structure).

**Result**: Model failed (near-miss) ✗

## Comparison: Success vs Failure Patterns

### Solved Task Characteristics (833dafe3)
- ✅ **Geometric transformations**: Simple flips and rotations
- ✅ **Compositional**: Each quadrant independently computed
- ✅ **No ambiguity**: Clear rules from training examples
- ✅ **Direct correspondence**: Input cells directly map to output regions

### Unsolved Task Characteristics (ad7e01d0)
- ❌ **Template instantiation**: Cells represent abstract symbols for decorative motifs
- ❌ **Multi-level abstraction**: Color → motif template → expanded pattern
- ❌ **Implicit structure**: Decorative cross patterns not explicitly shown in transformation
- ❌ **Near-miss**: Model captured high-level intent but missed precise implementation

## Technical Notes

### Extraction Method
- **Server**: vLLM on GPU 0,1 (port 8000)
- **Model**: openai/gpt-oss-20b
- **Max tokens**: 16,000
- **Temperature**: 0.3
- **Mode**: Natural text (not JSON) to allow full reasoning

### Key Discovery
GPT-OSS does NOT use OpenAI's separate `reasoning` field. Instead, all reasoning is embedded in the `content` field as structured natural language. This is why the original experiment logs showed "reasoning_content detected" but no actual text - the logging code expected a separate field.

### Impact on Main Experiment
- ✅ Main experiment (PID 45157) unaffected
- ✅ vLLM automatic queueing handled our requests safely
- ✅ No interference with ongoing 400-task evaluation
